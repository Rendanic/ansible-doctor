This project is based on the idea (and at some parts on the code) of [ansible-autodoc](https://github.com/AndresBott/ansible-autodoc) by Andres Bott so credits goes to him for his work.

_ansible-doctor_ is a simple annotation like documentation generator based on Jinja2 templates. While _ansible-doctor_ comes with a default template called `readme`, it is also possible to write your own templates. This gives you the ability to customize the output and render the data to every format you like (e.g. HTML or XML).

_ansible-doctor_ is designed to work within your CI pipeline to complete your testing and deployment workflow. Releases are available as Python Packages at [GitHub](https://github.com/xoxys/ansible-doctor/releases) or [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ansible-doctor/) and as Docker Image at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/xoxys/ansible-doctor).
